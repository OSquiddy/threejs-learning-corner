# Solar System

Live Demo: https://osquiddy-solar-system.netlify.app/

## Description

This project was created by following along with ZTM's [ThreeJS Crash Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM64t3pA4fs&t=1s&ab_channel=ZeroToMastery). It contains a basic solar system 3D, consisting of the Sun, a few planets and their moons. Each celestial body is rotating about its axis and revolves around the Sun in circular orbits. The scene is interactive, with a perspective camera that can be controlled using the mouse by either clicking and dragging, or scrolling to zoom in/out.

### Lessons Learned

- How to render a 3D environment using the ThreeJS library
- Basics of 3D Materials, UV Maps, Textures, Meshes etc
- How to animate an object

### Todo List

- [ ] Add the remaining planets and their moons
- [ ] Scale the models to be accurate in terms of size, speed, rotation-speed etc.
- [ ] Add the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter
- [ ] Figure out how to create elliptical orbits instead of circular ones
- [ ] See if there's a way to track the positions of each planetory object according to the calendar
